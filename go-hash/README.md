## Hash Tables in Go

This file is my attempt at coding hash tables using Golang. 
Hash tables already exists by using map(), however, it is always good
to try and solve this issue and see the inner workings of this data structure.

Just run this app:
```
go run main.go
```

To get a good idea of what this looks like, you can set a breakpoint and explore the code.
